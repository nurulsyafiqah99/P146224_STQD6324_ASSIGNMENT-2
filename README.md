**Flight Delay and Cancellation Analysis (US Flights 2005)**
This project explores patterns and causes of flight delays and cancellations using the 2005 US domestic flight dataset. The analysis was performed using Hive and Python. Key objectives include:

1) Delay Patterns
- To analyse times of day (morning/afternoon/evening) have the lowest average delays.
- To examine which days of the week show better on-time performance.
- To investigate which months or seasons are flights most likely to be on time.

2) Delay Factors
- To identify and rank the top 3-5 factors contributing to flight delays (based on the delay categories provided in the dataset).
- To quantify the impact of each factor (in minutes of delay and percentage of total delays).

3) Cancellation Analysis
- To identify the primary reasons for flight cancellations as categorized in the dataset.
- To determine if cancellations correlate with specific airlines, airports, or time periods.

4) Problematic Routes
- To identify specific routes (origin-destination pairs), carriers or flight numbers that show consistently poor performance.
- To analyse the reasons these particular flights are prone to delays or cancellations.
